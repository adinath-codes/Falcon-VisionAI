## üîé Problem Analysis & Insights

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Low Mean Pixel Accuracy (mPA)**

- **Observation:** Our model‚Äôs average **mPA ‚âà 0.7** across both training and test datasets.
- **Inference:** This indicates **underfitting** ‚Äî the model has not fully captured feature representations.
- **Action Taken:** We are **increasing the number of epochs** to allow deeper learning during training.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Low-Light Detection Failure**

- **Observation:** The model struggles to detect **Nitrogen Tanks**, **Tanks**, and **Safety Switches** in **`_dark_unclutter`** and **`_vdark_unclutter`** scenarios.
- **Inference:** The model lacks **robustness** to lighting variations, and feature extraction weakens under darkness.
- **Our Solution:**
  - **Low-light augmentation:** Generate **synthetic data** under varied dark conditions (shadows, glare, multiple darkness levels).
  - **Increased dark data ratio:** Add a higher proportion of **low-light samples** to train the model for **better generalization** in such environments.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Class Confusion & Misclassification**

- **Observation:** The model confuses **visually similar objects**, such as:
  - **Nitrogen Tank ‚Üî Fire Extinguisher**
  - **O‚ÇÇ Tank ‚Üî N‚ÇÇ Tank**
  - **Fire Alarm ‚Üî Safety Switch Panel ‚Üî Emergency Phone**
- **Inference:** This highlights a **class discrimination problem**. The confusion matrix shows repeated **false positives/negatives**.
- **Our Solution:**
  - **Targeted dataset generation:** Create synthetic datasets focusing **only on confusing pairs**.
  - **Visual variations:** Modify **angles, scales, and backgrounds** to highlight subtle differences.
  - **Future refinement:** Explore **YOLO architecture tweaks** later; for now, improving **data quality** is our top priority.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Occlusion Challenges**

- **Observation:** Detection fails when objects like **Nitrogen Tanks** and **Fire Extinguishers** are **partially occluded** in cluttered scenes.
- **Inference:** The model struggles with **occlusion**, as it cannot detect objects when only **partial features** are visible.
- **APPLIED SOLUTION:**
  - **Increase the Moscaic Value:** This Increase the amount of Occulsion Occurs and hence creating a much resilent model against Occulsion.

‚úÖ With these improvements, we aim to make our model **more robust, discriminative, and adaptable** to real-world scenarios.
